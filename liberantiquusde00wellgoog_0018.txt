Diooese being practically without 0 Bishop irem 1206 10 1213-
prevented the 01001001 entorcsment 01 this canon, bnt when Hugh
dc Wells cameto his See in 1213 he must have stirred vigorously

and at once in the matter, ior the book which follows vves written,
ior the most part, 00 11 appears, in 1218, aud it contains the record
cithu establishment 01 nearly 300 Vicerages The method pursued
in allotting Vicerages vos as follows r-An inquisition vas mado

in the Chapters 01 the Rural Deans into the velue 01 the 1100100100
and the competent portion to hc assigned to the Vienragce A
return was then made to the Bishop, vhe was to approve and

⁸ confirm the acts 01 the Chapters, or to alter them as he thought fit3

“ then the allotment was entered 10 the Bishop's register. The

amount usually assigned 10 the Viccr was about onethird 01 the
profils 01 the benefico, derived from the altar dues and tithes 5 as
well as a house, and some glebe. He hed to hear some part 01 the
caera incident to ecclesiastical benefices. His 001000 very commonly
amounted to five cr six marks The monastery was also 01100
charged to provide him 00 assistent. But the numerous and very ,
curicus variatione in the provisions ior the Vicars will best bc
judged from the following pagos The establishment 01 Vicarages
was greatly aided by the decrees 01 tho third Lateran Council in
1215, and especially by the Canens 01 the Council 01 Orferd held
under ArchbishopLengton 10 1221. The 13‚14,1c,1ccan0ns
01 this (1000011 100 down rules ior the settlemcnt 01 Vicarages
Tho sum specifisd as 0 fitting maiutcnance ior the Vicar is live
marks, “except 10 Weiss, where Vicars are content vvith less.”
Before the holding 01 this Council, and aiter the date ottho book
hero printed, it is recorded in the Accola 0112000101ἱο that Bishop
Hugh established five Vicarages 10 »the Charches belonging 10 the
Dunetable Canens* sc thet it is probable that the Bishop continued
to prosecute this important work with vigour, as did his successor, ’
Grosseteste, and hence the bitter wey in which both these Bishops
arc spoken 01 10 Mattheus Paris, th'e monh 01 St. Alban's. These
interosted in the early records 01 the Angliccu Ohurch can hardly
101110 101 much to gratify them in the curicus records here given

01 the foundation of se many 10001000.
